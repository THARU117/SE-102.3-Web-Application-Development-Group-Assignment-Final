<h4 style="color:white;"> Dondra Lighthouse   </h4> <br> <br>
<img src="C:\Users\Lapstore.lk\Desktop\test\loghthouse.jpg"  width="600" height="300"> <br><br>
<p style="color:white;">       Dondra Head Lighthouse is a lighthouse located on Dondra Head, Dondra, 
the southernmost point in<br> Sri Lanka and is Sri Lanka's tallest lighthouse and also one of the tallest in South East Asia. 
Dondra Head lighthouse is operated and <br>maintained by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority.
The lighthouse is near the village of Dondra, and is approximately<br> 6 km (3.7 mi) southeast of Matara.
 The name Dondra is a synonym for "Devi-Nuwara" in the local Sinhala language,<br> "Devi" meaning "Gods" and "Nuwara" meaning "City". D
ondra is therefore derived to mean "City of the Gods".

<h4 style="color:white;"> Galle Fort   </h4> <br> <br>
<img src="C:\Users\Lapstore.lk\Desktop\test\gallefort.jpg"  width="600" height="300"> <br><br>
<p style="color:white;">   Galle Fort in the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese, 
then <br>extensively fortified by the Dutch during the 17th century from 1649 onwards. 
It is a historical, archaeological and architectural<br> heritage monument, which even after more than 432 years maintains a polished appearance, 
due to extensive reconstruction work<br> done by Archaeological Department of Sri Lanka.
The fort has a colourful history, and today has a multi-ethnic and multi-religious population.
<br>The Sri Lankan government and many Dutch people who still own some of the properties inside the fort are looking at making this <br>one of the modern wonders of the world.
The heritage value of the fort has been recognized by the UNESCO and the site has been inscribed as a <br>cultural heritage UNESCO World Heritage Site under criteria iv,
 for its unique exposition of "an urban ensemble which illustrates the interaction of European <br>architecture and South Asian traditions from the 16th to the 19th centuries."
The Galle Fort, also known as the Dutch Fort or the "Ramparts of Galle", withstood the<br> Boxing Day tsunami which damaged part of coastal area Galle town.
 It has been since restored.
